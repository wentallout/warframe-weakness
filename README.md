# Warframe Weakness - wawe

URL: warframe-weakness.netlify.app

## What is this? Why did I create this?

I want to have a dynamic, interactive way to see each faction weakness in Warframe. Now some people would say this is redundant since a good build will kill anyways and you don't need to worry about every faction and I'm like, we are in Warframe, we play to min-max, not to win.

## Features

- 12 Factions with weaknesses and resistance
- Sort/Search table

## Todo list

- Weapon builds recommendation (so if user click Corrosive they will see a list of great Corrosive gun builds, I might need help from Overframe devs if I want to make this work?)
- Tooltip that shows info when user hover a table cell
- Refactor codes
- Better Animation
- Add more Graphics

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
